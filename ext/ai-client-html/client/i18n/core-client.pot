#. /html/catalog/attribute/type
#. * List of layout types for the optional attributes
#. *
#. * Each product can contain optional attributes and this configuration setting
#. * allows you to change how these attributs will be displayed, either as
#. * drop-down menu (value: "select") or as list of radio buttons (value:
#. * "radio").
#. *
#. * The key for each value must be the type code of the attribute, e.g. "width",
#. * "length", "color" or similar types. You can set the layout for all
#. * attributes at once using e.g.
#. *
#. *  client/html/catalog/attribute/type = array(
#. *      'width' => 'select',
#. *      'color' => 'radio',
#. *  )
#. *
#. * Similarly, you can set the layout type for a specific attribute only,
#. * leaving the rest untouched:
#. *
#. *  client/html/catalog/attribute/type/color = radio
#. *
#. * Note: Up to 2015.10 this option was available as
#. /html/catalog/detail/basket/attribute/type

#. * is selected by default.
#. *
#. * The key for each value must be the type code of the attribute, e.g. "width",
