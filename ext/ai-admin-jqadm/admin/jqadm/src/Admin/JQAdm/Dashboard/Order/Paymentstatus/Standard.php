	 * List of JQAdm sub-clients rendered within the dashboard paymentstatus section
	 *
	 * The output of the frontend is composed of the code generated by the JQAdm
	 * clients. Each JQAdm client can consist of serveral (or none) sub-clients
	 * that are responsible for rendering certain sub-parts of the output. The
	 * sub-clients can contain JQAdm clients themselves and therefore a
	 * hierarchical tree of JQAdm clients is composed. Each JQAdm client creates
	 * the output that is placed inside the container of its parent.
	 *
	 * At first, always the JQAdm code generated by the parent is printed, then
	 * the JQAdm code of its sub-clients. The order of the JQAdm sub-clients
	 * determines the order of the output of these sub-clients inside the parent
	 * container. If the configured list of clients is
	 *
	 *  array( "subclient1", "subclient2" )
	 *
	 * you can easily change the order of the output by reordering the subparts:
	 *
	 *  admin/jqadm/<clients>/subparts = array( "subclient1", "subclient2" )
	 *
	 * You can also remove one or more parts if they shouldn't be rendered:
	 *
	 *  admin/jqadm/<clients>/subparts = array( "subclient1" )
	 *
	 * As the clients only generates structural JQAdm, the layout defined via CSS
	 * should support adding, removing or reordering content by a fluid like
	 * design.
